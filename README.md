<h1>Minecraft Java Mod</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This was my first time using the Java coding language as well as creating a mod for the Java version of Minecraft. I added in a new simple item called "Solstheimite" which is a new mineral which I plan on soon making more adjustments to
the mod to make it more versatile like its counterparts.
